# antivirus-updater

As an itinerant IT technician I often find a usb key full of up-to-date offline portable antivirus tools to be enormously useful. BUT I hate the time it takes to check for and download updates for them all every time I am called upon.

So I wrote this hacky tool.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have node.js installed.
2. Download this
3. In its directory run `npm install` then `node update.js`
